# Clinic Management system Database

My project is a relational database system for managing the daily operations of a healthcare clinic. It supports multiple roles (doctors, nurses, receptionists, lab staff, administrators), and covers key domains such as patient records, appointments, billing, prescriptions, inventory, staff scheduling, and medical history.

## How to Set Up and Run the Project
### Prerequisites:
- MySQL Server
- MySQL Workbench
- My .sql file containing the schema

## Step-by-Step Guide:
### Using MySQL Workbench
1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Connect to your MySQL instance (localhost, default username: root, password: "" or as set)
3. Import the SQL script:
    - Go to File > Open SQL Script and select your .sql file
    - Click the ⚡️ Execute button.
    - This will run the full script and create all tables and relationships
